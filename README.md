Hellofresh test project

# Journey
Enabled ES6 usage with babel support. Abstracted database api. Created a separate folder especially for validations. Validations are done for every end point via middleware style. All the API calls respond in same style, giving consistency and symmetry to responses either errors or success responses. 

Example of success result 
```
{ 
    status     : "success",
    statusCode : 200
    message    : "successfully fetched",
    data       : {} 
}
```

Example of error result
```
{ 
    status     : "error",
    statusCode : 400
    message    : id param is required"   
}
```

#### Search recipe
Made mongodb indexing on recipe name. Also made flexible search api by giving options like
**language**,**case sensitive**, **diacritic sensitive**

Also maintained good file structure, i.e same respective functionality file names and function names.
```
src
    routes
        recipe
    validations
        recipe
    controllers
        recipe        
```    

Finally wrote api tests in way that a "test" database is created and dropped once tests are done.


# Getting Started by docker

## Fork and clone the repository and run. 

``docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d --build``

which runs a nodejs server on default port on 8080 and mongodb on 27017.
End point is **http://docker-machine-ip:8080**

#### On successfull run, a default server admin is created with following credentials

- email    : `admin@admin.com`
- password : `admin`  


## To run api tests

``docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d --build``

## Tweak environments
You can change environments in  src/config/keys.js file

Example: under src/config/keys.js
```
{
  development : {
    mongodbConnectUri: "mongodb://mongodb:27017"
  }
}
```
and set environment in docker-compose files

Example: under docker-compose.yml
```
environment:
    NODE_ENV : development
```
